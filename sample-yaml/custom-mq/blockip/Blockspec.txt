#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Description of security specification:
# This specification will allow:
# - connections from 10.1.*, 172.20.31, and 127.0.0.1, 127.0.1.1, ... 127.0.9.1
# Networks. Entries are separated using comma(,)
# - allow userids: xxx, yyy, etc, mqm and mrmq. Together with users
# starting with zzz<something> and users beginning with us<three chars>mq.
#
# - BlockMqmUsers=Y; means that following users are blocked: mqm,
# MUSR_MQADMIN and musr_mqadmin.
# All specs must end with a semicolon ; anything after ; is parsed as a comment
# Important:
# If you specify Patterns twice they are concatenated, so they are all used
# for matching.
#
# It's very important that all specs are terminated with semicolon(;) otherwise
# you will receive connection refused. Because I think it's best only to use
# positive error-free identification
# The patterns are separated using comma(,) This is also important to remember
